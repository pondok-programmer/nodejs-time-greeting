# NodeJS Time Greeting

This repository is how to make greeting using nodejs depending on time.

## Quickstart

```
  git clone https://github.com/afrijaldz/nodejs-time-greeting.git
  cd nodejs-time-greeting
  npm i
  npm start
```

## File Structure

The `time.js` file is used to make condition about what time is now and set the greeting word to send it to `index.js`. We use `moment` package to get the time.

In `index.js` We use `express` to make it runs in browser and import the time from `time.js`.
